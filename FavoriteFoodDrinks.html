                                <p> On this page, I will be sharing with you all my favorite foods and my least favorite foods.
                                </p>
                          
                                <p> <li>I LOVE BOBA. Why you might ask? Simple. I just like it, there is no "why" and there is no stopping me.</li>
                                  <li>Hamburgers are ok---? A lot of times, they put too much sauce and when I take a bite, the area around my lips turn into a goopey
                                  mess of mayonaise and mustard. In-N-Out is the only exception!</li>
                                  <li>I HATE KIWIS! They are "kiwiing" (killing) me! Whenever I eat them, my lips go all itchy and have the urge to 
                                    rub them on sandpaper.</li>
                                  <li>Mangoes are okay, but mango flavored stuff is AWESOME. I actually really don't know why I like artificially flavored mango food items
                                    so much, but they just taste better than the normal mango. In other words, it is "Mango-nificent!"</li>
