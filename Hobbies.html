                  <p> <li>I like to stare off into space. Now don't you dare question me because if you do, expect me to answer you with my fist.</li>
                    <li>I like to fiddle with things. When I'm bored or nervouse I just like to fiddle with things. And by the way I HATE FIDGET SPINNERS!</li>
                    <li> I like to read. Prefferably COMICS</li>
                    <li> Perhaps watch YouTube and tey to forget about piano...</li>
