                          <p> My one and only special talent is messing everything up everything up during a vital moment, meaning 
                          (for example) Just as I finish a clay sculpture, I accidentally drop it and it shatters into pieces.
                          I am not double jointed in any way, so I have nothing to show off. *sigh*
